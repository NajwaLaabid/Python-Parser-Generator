# Python-Parser-Generator
Program to automatically generate an LL(1) recurive descent parser for your grammar (grammar should be LL(1) compatible and in BNF or EBNF format).

"grammar.txt" contains a concrete example for your inspiration. You can run the programm "grammar_checker" to ensure the requirements needed are met.

## How to use the program

1. Download and install the [newest Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) version.
2. Clone this repo locally.
3. Prepare a grammar meeting the requirements mentioned above and a few texts for testing.
4. Run the program to generate a parser for your grammar. The parser generated will be in Python as well.
5. Test your parser on the texts you created in step 3. 
6. Your parser should be working as intended. If it is not, let me know through the issues section.
