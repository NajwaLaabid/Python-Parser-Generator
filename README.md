# Python-Parser-Generator
Program to automatically generate an LL(1) recurive descent parser for your grammar (grammar should be LL(1) compatible and in BNF or EBNF format).

To use this programm you need:
- A grammar respecting the BNF & LL(1) recursive descent rules. "grammar.txt" contains a concrete example for your inspiration. You can run the programm "grammar_checker" to ensure the requirements needed are met.
- The RD parser will be posted soon!
